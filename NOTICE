taujs [ τjs ] Orchestration System

Author: John Smith

This project introduces the taujs [ τjs ] orchestration model — a declarative, build-time system for managing microfrontend applications. It replaces traditional runtime module federation with a composable, server-side orchestration layer optimized for SSR, streaming, and middleware composition.

taujs [ τjs ] enables:

- Explicit route-to-app orchestration via `taujs.config.ts`
- Isolated app build pipelines with plugin extensibility
- Per-route rendering control (`ssr`, `stream`)
- Optional hydration toggles and middleware composition
