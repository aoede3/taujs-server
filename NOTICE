τjs [ taujs ] Orchestration System

Author: John Smith

This project introduces the τjs [ taujs ] orchestration model - a declarative, build-time system for managing microfrontend applications. It replaces traditional runtime module federation with a composable, server-side orchestration layer optimized for SSR, streaming, and middleware composition.

τjs [ taujs ] enables:

- Explicit route-to-app orchestration via `taujs.config.ts`
- Isolated app build pipelines with plugin extensibility
- Per-route rendering control (`csr`, `ssr`, `stream`)
- Optional hydration toggles and middleware composition
